At AboutUs there is no formal code review process. We collectively own the code and we pair a ton, so most code gets seen by at least two people before it hits production. We also have a [Big Red Light](http://dev.aboutus.org/2011/04/19/our-continuous-integration-is-a-big-red-flashing-light.html) to keep us in line. To keep even better coverage, we have a daily habit of reviewing and commenting on the commits made by others in Github. This is incredibly useful. Most of the chatter is just run of the mill knowledge sharing, but sometimes some good conversations pop up. One of these conversations started the other day when one of our devs used that Princess Bride quote above in response to a commit.

One of the benefits of working at AboutUs is that we have Ward Cunningham as an advisor and contributor. Ward was CTO when I came on board and although he's moved on to other projects he's kept a close relationship with AboutUs. Ward often chimes in on commits, and this conversation was no different. Along with his usual pearls of wisdom he mentioned this:
