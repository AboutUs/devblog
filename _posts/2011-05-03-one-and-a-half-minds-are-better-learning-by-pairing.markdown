teaching me all about AboutUs.org's technology via one of our favorite agile
practices: Pair programming!

My name is Brad Heller and I've *just* started at AboutUs.org as one of their
new agile developer! AboutUs.org has a pretty interesting way to ramping their
new guys: Pairing! Erm, well, that's not really all that different from how we
*normally* do our work but it is a great way to learn about a company's
technology. 

In reality a lot of agile shops introduce new people to their stack via a strong
dose of pair programming, either formally or informally. Here are a few helpful
ideas if you ever find yourself learning new technology via pairing.

Figure out a system that allows you to take of notes.

This is actually a lot more difficult than it sounds. When you're pairing a lot
of times the person in the know moves pretty quick. As such, taking notes can
be hard. I don't know how many times I've asked the same question for the Nth
time because I didn't take notes.

Don't be afraid to drive sometimes.

You can't let the teacher also be the student -- you have to get your hands
dirty if you want to learn anything! Besides, this is the best time dive in as
you've got a saftey net sitting right next to you (a la the teacher) in case you
mess up (erm, that is *when* you mess up).

Try to set up a workstation with multiple input devices (keyboards, mice, etc.)
so that everyone has one.

This is good pairing-in-general advice. At AboutUs we have "pairing stations"
with two keyboards, two mice, and plenty of screen realestate.
