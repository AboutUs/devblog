Many agile teams keep track of
[velocity](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ProjectVelocity) as a measure of
their performance.[^1] This is a useful measure, but it shouldn't be
the only one. This past week we realized that another performance metric of
an agile team should be how much work it *avoids* doing.

During a discussion with stakeholders last week, we realized that much
of the work in our queue was a temporary fix for a problem we would
ultimately solve at a later date. Thanks to the stakeholders keeping
their own planning queue in a visible location, the development team
was able to see that the proper fix for the problem was scheduled for
just a few weeks later. We engaged the primary stakeholder in a
discussion about the requirements of the proper fix, and deemed that
it would be no more work than the temporary fix. Naturally, we started
work on the proper fix, abandoning the temporary one &mdash; and eliminated
nearly a weekâ€™s worth of work!

Velocity is a great metric to track, but perhaps agile teams should
also get in the habit of tracking work avoided on account of
successful communication. After all, the best code is no code at all.

[^1]: This, of course, is not the recommended use for velocity, but remains a method of measuring performance.
